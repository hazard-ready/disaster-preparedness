rasterTileMaxDimension = 5000
3 rasters loaded:
	OR_lsd (the really big one, with an Oregon-sized chunk of the Pacific included) 10,5503x43,321 pixels = 4.57GB after type conversion
	casceq_m9pgv1 (still the whole state, but at a coarser resolution) 24158x12604 pixels = 304.6MB after type conversion
	Wildfire_risk (cropped, so relatively small) 5465x4088 pixels = 23.1MB after type conversion

LARGER TILES:
Try tile size of 8053 because that would get the EQ file into only 3 tiles and wildfires into 1 tile.



SMALLER TILES:
Try tile size of 1000 and see what happens
What about 100?
10?
1?





INDEXED SEARCH:
Try making Django/Postgis prefilter by bounding box instead of stepping through them.
