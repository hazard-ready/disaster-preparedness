        <h6>How does it work?</h6>
        <p>MissoulaReady is designed to help people prepare for disasters that occur in their area. Disasters donâ€™t strike locations equally so we found it important to give people location
        specific information in order to properly prepare. MissoulaReady organizes current information and packages it in a way that makes it accessible for any Missoula County
        resident.</p>
        <p>This site uses the most up-to-date hazard risk data available for Missoula County, Montana. The descriptions of risk and how to prepare for those risks are based on best information from the American Red Cross and the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Data used for MissoulaReady is available for download here.</p>

        <h6>Who made this?</h6>
        <p>This is based on <a href="http://www.opb.org/news/widget/aftershock-find-your-cascadia-earthquake-story/">Aftershock</a>, an earthquake preparedness application for Oregon residents. Carson MacPherson-Krutsky and <a href="http://www.hs.umt.edu/geosciences/faculty/bendick/">Dr. Rebecca Bendick</a>, a graduate student and her advisor at the Unversity of Montana, had the idea to expand it for other locales and types of disasters. Melinda Minch and Eldan Goldenberg adapted it for that purpose.</p>
