        <p>{{ settings.site_title }} is designed to help people prepare for disasters that occur in their area. Disasters donâ€™t strike locations equally so we found it important to give people location
        specific information in order to properly prepare. {{ settings.site_title }} organizes current information and packages it in a way that makes it accessible for any {{ location.area_name }}
        resident.</p>
        <p>This site uses the most up-to-date hazard risk data available for {{ location.area_name }}. The descriptions of risk and how to prepare for those risks are based on best information from the American Red Cross and the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
