"How we build Hazard Ready Sites: 1. Gather data. Locate the most relevant "
"and up-to-date data on natural hazards for your region from trusted sources "
"like FEMA, NOAA, and the USGS. 2. Quality Check. Work with local partners "
"(community groups & emergency managers) to ensure the data and infomration "
"are accurate. 3. Process data. Take in raw data and make it compatible with "
"the backend Hazard Ready framework. 4. Build content. Write the webpage "
"text, gather images and videos, locate local resources for each hazard and "
"region. 5. Feedback and focus groups. Go back and forth on content and "
"designs to ensure the information is location specific and relevant to the "
"community's needs. 6. Revise, revise, revise."
