Earthquake,What's the worst that could happen,1,,,,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNN7eDXzlMo,<p><b>What does Magnitude tell us?</b><br><br>The Richter Magnitude is a measure of how much energy is released during an earthquake. Click on the video to learn more.</p>,RDPO_region,RDPO,,,<p><b>The most-likely and worst-case scenarios are one and the same. </b> Seismologists (earthquake scientists) know that a magnitude 8-9 earthquake is overdue for this region. It’s not clear exactly what magnitude the earthquake will be&#44; but on all accounts it is going to be big.  The shaking will last for minutes and cause light to major damage across the Northwest. Power and water could be off for days to weeks.</p>,,,

Earthquake,Past earthquake in Oregon,1,,,,,,RDPO_region,RDPO,,,"<h3>Big deep earthquakes</h3>
<p>At about 9pm (PST) on January 26&#44; 1700 a magnitude 8 or greater earthquake struck the west coast of the US. It shook the ground from Canada to California for 3-4 minutes. A tsunami wave followed. Research suggests that big subduction zone earthquakes&#44; like this one&#44; happen on average every 234 years. It’s been over 300 years since the last one. This means now is a pretty good time to get prepared. Read <a href=""https://www.opb.org/news/series/unprepared/jan-26-1700-how-scientists-know-when-the-last-big-earthquake-happened-here/"" target=_blank>OPB’s awesome article</a> about how scientists know the time and size of the 1700 event. It is riveting!</p>

<h3>Shallow moderate earthquakes</h3>
<p>1993 was a big year for earthquakes in Oregon. The Scotts Mills (magnitude 5.6) earthquake occurred south of Portland near Canby&#44; OR. It shook areas nearby causing chimneys to topple and some walls to crack. Damages totaled about 28 million. That same year the Klamath Falls earthquakes (magnitude 5.9 and 6.0) hit in southern Oregon. They caused landslides killing a motorcyclist and damaged buildings. It cost about 10 million in damages.</p>",slider,,
